### April 4, 2026 -- Continued Session (Free-Tier UX, Upgrade Messaging, Trial Enforcement)

#### Dashboard Crash Fix (commit 16522e8)
useSubscription() was destructured at line 556, but tier was used at line 369
in a useState initializer (lessonViewMode). "Cannot access before initialization"
crash on every dashboard load. Fix: moved useSubscription() block to line 364,
immediately after expandedStep useState.

#### Free-Tier Lesson Viewer Default (commits a3d84fe, 16522e8)
lessonViewMode useState initialized to "full" unconditionally. Free-tier user
(Jana Thomas) saw all 8 sections by default. Fix: useState now conditionally
initializes based on tier; useEffect sets "free" for non-paid users.
aria-pressed and aria-label added to Preview Mode toggle buttons per Rule 22.

#### Trial Counter Error Handling (commit a737c3f)
generate-lesson Edge Function trial increment (profiles.update) had no error
handling. Silent failure would leave counter at 0 permanently, granting
unlimited free lessons. Fix: destructure { error: trialUpdateError }, log
CRITICAL on failure. Edge Function redeployed via npx supabase functions deploy.

#### Hybrid Free-Tier Sidebar Navigation (commit fa8561f)
sidebarConfig.ts: Added NavItemTierGate type and tierGate property to every
SidebarItem. AppShell.tsx: useSubscription() added; locked items render at
opacity-50 with Lock icon, open UpgradePromptModal on click; hidden_free
items use conditional rendering. WCAG 2.1 AA: aria-disabled, aria-label,
tabIndex, aria-hidden on icons, onKeyDown for Enter/Space.

#### Upgrade Modal -- Iterative Copy and Structure (commits fa8561f, 161cda9)
Multiple rounds of copy refinement on UpgradePromptModal.tsx:
- Default billing interval changed from monthly to yearly
- Title: "Ready to Do Even More for Your Class?"
- Description: acknowledges teacher's first step, describes Personal Plan value
- Contrast anchor line: "A good lesson teaches. An equipped teacher disciples."
- Two columns: "WHERE YOU ARE" vs "WHERE YOU COULD TAKE THEM"
- Band 1: all 10 lesson sections with Check icons
- Band 2 "BEYOND SUNDAY": DevotionalSpark, Series, Publish with Star icons
- Summary: "A free account prepares a lesson. The Personal Plan equips a class."
- Button: "Yes -- Let's Do More"
- Cancellation notice: "Cancel anytime before your next billing date."
- All icons aria-hidden="true", buttons have descriptive aria-labels

#### UsageDisplay Exhausted Banner (commit 161cda9)
When both full and short lessons exhausted, UsageDisplay shows amber banner
with heading, reset date, class-focused upgrade messaging, "Equip My Class"
button, and feature summary line. role="alert" for screen reader announcement.

#### EnhanceLessonForm Blocked Notice (commit 161cda9)
Amber banner above Step 1 when subLessonsUsed >= subLessonsLimit. Lock icon
(aria-hidden), class-focused subtext, "Equip My Class -- Upgrade Now" button.
role="alert" and aria-live="polite" for screen readers.

#### Welcome Banner Condition Fix (commit 161cda9)
Changed from !step1Complete && !step2Complete to subLessonsUsed < subLessonsLimit.
Banner now hidden when limit is reached, preventing confusing juxtaposition of
"Welcome!" and "Limit reached" messages.

#### DOCX Export Crash Fix (commit e6398a3)
buildTeaserBox used bodyFontHalfPt from wrong scope (module-level function
referencing local variable). Added fontHalfPt parameter. buildTextRuns default
parameter had same scope bug -- changed to body.fontHalfPt.

#### CLAUDE.md Structural Obligations (commit 1e5d7ba)
Added three missing governance sections: Mandatory Session-End Protocol,
Hold-Before-Deploy discipline in deploy sequence, Path Verification Before
Every File Write. Date header updated to April 4, 2026.
